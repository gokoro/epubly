Epubly is a blazingly-fast, Rust-powered Node.js library for EPUB editing. With its powerful and flexible API, Epubly simplifies and streamlines the process of manipulating EPUB files.

## Installation

Install via NPM:

```
npm install @epubly/core
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Epub } from '@epubly/core'

const epub = new Epub('./my-book.epub')

// Read filenames from epub
epub.readFileNames()

// Read the contens of specific file
epub.readFileContentByName('intro.xhtml')

// Write to epub file and export the epub
// You need to call the `epub.extract()` first.
epub.extract()
epub.epub.writeFileContentByName('intro.xhtml', 'Hello ðŸ˜€')
epub.exportFile('./modified.epub')
```
